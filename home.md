# Welcome

Looks like you've found my wiki!

On the left side you will find [about me](./adamzvolanek.md), [install docs](./installs.md), and [backup procedures](./backups.md). This wiki's goal is to become a single-pane of glass to document my installation and maintenance of my server Unraid server: Alexandria.

For outside contributions, please create a pull request at the [DevRackDocs](https://github.com/adamzvolanek/DevRackDocs) repository.
