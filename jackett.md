# Jackett

This page covers the setup of jackett to deploy in my docker-compose stack(s).

This procedure has been **deprecated** and instead using [Prowlarr](./prowlarr).

## Manual Steps

### Adding Indexers

- Select the 'Add indexer' button
- Under the 'Type' drop-down, select 'Public'
- Select the green plus symbol to add the indexer

### Adding to *arr family account

Instructions are provided in Jackett for adding indexers to the *arr family, however additional instructions can be found on [radarr](./radarr) and [sonarr](./sonarr).

## Automated Install

Pending however most likely to be automatically configured on deployment.
