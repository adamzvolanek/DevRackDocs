# Photoprism

This page covers the setup of Photoprism to deploy in my docker-compose stack(s). This also includes some picture share directory setup and preparation. The Photoprism will be a public facing photo library as an alternate to my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/zvolanek.photography/). Family photos are hosted with an [immich](./immich) instance.
