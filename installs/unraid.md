# Unraid

My server is based on Unraid and will transition to ZFS-based hard disks. Developement is done on a decade+ old laptop that runs Unraid purely for docker-compose develpoment.

## Prerequisite

Requires a USB Flash drive.

## Download

The free 30-day trail of Unraid can be found [here](https://unraid.net/download).

A flash drive ISO can be found in my DevRack repository. Link to the Unraid 6.9.2 ISO is pending.

### Physical Action

Plug in flash drive to laptop and allow boot to flash-drive.
