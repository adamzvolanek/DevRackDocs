# Welcome

Looks like you've found my wiki!

On the left side you will find [about me](./adamzvolanek)/[about me (BookStack compatible](./me-adam), [install docs](./installs), and [backup procedures](./backups)/[backup procedures (BookStack compatible)](../../../backups). This wiki's goal is to become a single-pane of glass to document my installation and maintenance of my server Unraid server: Alexandria.

As seen above, links are not perfectly aligned between WikiJs's (my GitHub Docs) directory structure and as a result BookStack's hosted links may be broken. BookStack's organization is different, and can be viewed [here](./bookstack)/[here (BookStack compatible)](../../../docker-stacks/page/bookstack)

For outside contributions, please create a pull request at the [DevRackDocs](https://github.com/adamzvolanek/DevRackDocs) repository.
