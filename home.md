# Welcome

Looks like you've found my wiki! To navigate, treat the left side like a file-system tree.

On the left side you will find [about me](./adamzvolanek.md), [install docs](./installs.md), and [backup procedures](./backups.md) sections. This wiki serves to become a single-pane of glass to document my installation and maintenance of my server Unraid server Alexandria.

For outside contributions, please create a pull request at the [DevRackDocs](https://github.com/adamzvolanek/DevRackDocs) repository.
