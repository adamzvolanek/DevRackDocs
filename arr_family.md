# Arr Guides

Contents here will include setup and configuration of various arr tools: Radarr, Sonarr, and Jackett. In the future Jackett will be replaced by Prowlarr.

## UnRaid Setup

Follow the steps outlined by [TRaSH Guide for unRAID](https://trash-guides.info/Hardlinks/How-to-setup-for/Unraid/#unraid) for configuring the Unraid OS and file structure.

My documentation differs in that I omit top level folder `data`. Instead of `/mnt/user/data/media/` I use `/mnt/user/media/`.

Many of the arr tool installation and configuration can be accompanied by [TRaSH Guides](https://trash-guides.info/).

## Generating Arr API Keys
